I designed a simple GUI in python to be a crosshair overlay for gaming. 

I want to be able to choose between a circle, square, triangle, or an X as the overlay:
radioButton should enable the X overlay
radioButton2 should enable the Triangle overlay
radioButton3 should enable the Square overlay
radioButton4 should enable the Circle overlay

Using a keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+Shift+O should enable or disable the overlay.

If the program is in the forground, the user should be able to click and drag the overlay to resize it.
To bring the program to the forground, the shortcut should be Ctrl+O
To hide the program, the shortcut should be Ctrl+O
If the program is hidden, the overlay should still be showing. Only disable the overlay if the user chooses to disable it by pressing Ctrl+Shift+O.

Whatever crosshair the user selects, it should be centered on the screen, even when it's resized. For example, the center of the X should be in the exact center point of the screen no matter what the users resolution is. If the X is resized, the center of the X should still remain in the exact center point of the users screen. 

The user should be able to press Ctrl+Shift+I to cycle the color of the crosshair. Id like a couple shades of each color to be in the cycle. For example: light blue, dark blue, light purple, dark purple, etc. maybe some neon colors as well, and black and white. 

Keep in mind, this will end up being compiled into a EXE file so it should be coded in a way that works in both python and exe format. 

When the crosshair overlay is enabled, the only thing that should be showing is the crosshair. the rest of the screen should be invisible, showing the game in the background.
